# Task-Manager-Python
This is a simple task management program made using Python.
It works in the command line and helps users manage their daily tasks easily.

I created this project to practice Python basics like lists, loops, and conditionals.

**What this program can do**

Take tasks from the user
Add new tasks
Update existing tasks
Delete tasks
Show all tasks
Exit the program safely

**Language Used**
Python 3

**Files in this Project**
task_manager.py
README.md

**How to Run the Program**
Install Python (if not already installed)
Save the code in a file named task_manager.py
Open Command Prompt / Terminal
Run this command:
python task_manager.py

**How the Program Works**
First, the user enters how many tasks they want to add.
Those tasks are stored in a list.
After that, a menu appears with options:
Add task
Update task
Delete task
View tasks
Exit
The program keeps running until the user chooses Exit.

**Example Output**
------WELCOME TO THE TASK MANAGEMENT APP------
Enter how many task you want to add= 3
Enter task 1 = Study Python
Enter task 2 = Do assignment
Enter task 3 = Revise notes

Today's tasks are
['Study Python', 'Do assignment', 'Revise notes']

**Concepts Used**
Python lists
append() function
index() method
del keyword
while loop
if-elif-else conditions
User input using input()

**Why I Made This Project**
I made this project to:
Practice Python basics
Understand how list operations work
Learn how menu-driven programs work
