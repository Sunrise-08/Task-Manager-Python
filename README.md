# Task-Manager-Python
This is a simple task management program made using Python.
It works in the command line and helps users manage their daily tasks easily.
<br>
I created this project to practice Python basics like lists, loops, and conditionals.
<br>

**What this program can do**
<br>
Take tasks from the user
<br>
Add new tasks
<br>
Update existing tasks
<br>
Delete tasks
<br>
Show all tasks
<br>
Exit the program safely
<br>
**Language Used**
<br>
Python 3
<br>
**Files in this Project**
<br>
task_manager.py
<br>
README.md
<br>
**How to Run the Program**
<br>
Install Python (if not already installed)
<br>
Save the code in a file named task_manager.py
<br>
Open Command Prompt / Terminal
<br>
Run this command:
<br>
python task_manager.py
<br>
**How the Program Works**
<br>
First, the user enters how many tasks they want to add.
<br>
Those tasks are stored in a list.
<br>
After that, a menu appears with options:
<br>
Add task
<br>
Update task
<br>
Delete task
<br>
View tasks
<br>
Exit
<br>
The program keeps running until the user chooses Exit.
<br>
**Example Output**
<br>
------WELCOME TO THE TASK MANAGEMENT APP------
<br>
Enter how many task you want to add= 3
<br>
Enter task 1 = Study Python
<br>
Enter task 2 = Do assignment
<br>
Enter task 3 = Revise notes
<br>
Today's tasks are
<br>
['Study Python', 'Do assignment', 'Revise notes']
<br>
**Concepts Used**
<br>
Python lists
<br>
append() function
<br>
index() method
<br>
del keyword
<br>
while loop
<br>
if-elif-else conditions
<br>
User input using input()
<br>

**Why I Made This Project**
<br>
I made this project to:
<br>
Practice Python basics
<br>
Understand how list operations work
<br>
Learn how menu-driven programs work
